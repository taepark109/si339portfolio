      <h1>Mind and Music</h1>
      <h2>Goal of Project:</h2>
      <p>Research if the general top Hot100 songs are the top hits for a reason. I also wanted to see if it would yield similar results for specific genres, such as Pop or Alternative. Is it because of the songsâ€™ valence? Their danceability?</p>
      <br>
      <h2>My Solution</h2>
      <p>Using Billboard API and Spotify API, I analyzed trends in the relationship between music qualities such as danceability and valence, and their rank in the top charts. I was able to discover that the top hits may not be as enigmatic as one may intitially think.</p>
